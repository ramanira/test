## Prerequisites

### AWS Account

In order to complete these workshops you'll need a valid, usable AWS Account with Admin permissions.  The code and instructions in these workshops assume only one student is using a given AWS account at a time. If you try sharing an account with another student, you'll run into naming conflicts for certain resources. 

Use a **personal account** or create a new AWS account to ensure you have the neccessary access. This should not be an AWS account from the company you work for.

All of the resources you will launch as part of these workshops are eligible for the AWS free tier if your account is less than 12 months old. See the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) page for more details.  If you are doing this workshop as part of an AWS sponsored event, you will receive credits to cover the costs.

### Cloudformation templates for initial environment setup

Please run these cloudformation stacks in your AWS account as this is required for all the workshops

[![Deploy IAM user creation stack](images/cloudformation-launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?#/stacks/new?stackName=cryptoworkshops-env-iam-user-creation&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/crypto-builders-cf-templates/template\_create\_user.yaml)

The above stack creates an IAM user called **builders-session-user** .Before you launch the next stack please login into your account as the **builders-session-user**
